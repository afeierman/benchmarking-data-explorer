# The Benchmarking Data Explorer

About a decade ago, progressive cities and states in the US begun passing legislation that requires the owners of large buildings to measure and report building energy consumption on an annual basis.  In most cases, cities post these datasets onto open data portals. My project analyzed some of this publicly available data, exploring trends in building energy consumption and building a proof-of-concept to see if building energy data across the country could be easily compiled into a central, easy to use repository.

This project was created as part of NYC Data Science Academy's Data Science Bootcamp. This project was focused on using the R Shiny framework to visualize and analyze data.
